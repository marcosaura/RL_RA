## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents to make decisions in dynamic environments. This repository provides implementations of various RL models, with a special focus on DDQN. Additionally, it explores the integration of ring attractors, which are neural mechanisms that can be used for spatial representation and navigation in the context of RL.

## DDQN Implementation

The DDQN implementation in this repository is designed for easy integration and experimentation. It builds on the principles of Q-Learning and addresses challenges such as overestimation of action values by using two separate neural networks for action selection and value estimation.

## Ring Attractors

Ring attractors are mathematical constructs that exhibit stable patterns of activity in a circular or ring-shaped neural network. These structures have shown promise in various applications, including spatial representation and navigation. This repository provides tools and resources for studying the interaction of RL models, such as DDQN, with ring attractors.
